Ng Yin Cheang is an **incoming PhD student in Computer Science at Tsinghua University**, with a strong interdisciplinary background in numerical methods, scientific computing, and machine learning. He holds a Master’s degree in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering from Tsinghua and a Bachelor’s degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Beihang University.

Previously, Yin Cheang served as a **Senior Data Scientist at SPH Media**, where he led the development of personalized news recommendation systems for Singapore’s largest Chinese-language news platform. His projects included content-based retrieval, multi-objective ranking models, and system-wide recommender pipelines, achieving measurable gains in user engagement and CTR.

At **Shopee Singapore**, he worked as an **Algorithm Engineer**, applying deep learning techniques such as BERT, Sent2Vec, and TripletLoss to tasks like product classification, device fingerprinting, and keyword mining. He also gained experience in deploying optimized models using TensorRT.

His earlier work at **JD Digits** focused on risk modeling using NLP for cash-out behavior detection, achieving high precision in production environments. He has also conducted research on GANs for text generation during an internship at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

His research interests lie at the intersection of **Numerical Methgod, machine learning, and high-performance computing**.
